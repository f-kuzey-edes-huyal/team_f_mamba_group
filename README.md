Kuzey's approach:

[VM-UNet: Vision Mamba UNet for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02491)

When they initialized VM-UNET with VMamba-T and VMamba-S pre-trained weights, they demonstrated significant improvement especialy for VMamba-S weights. Could we find pre-trained models for our task?
Discussions on pre-trained weights for satellite image classification: [https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/361890/pre-trained-transfer-learning-models-for-satellite-image-classification]

Some tensorflow [pre-trained weights](https://bigearth.net/)?

The [code](https://github.com/JCruan519/VM-UNet) they provided on their GitHub was designed for a Linux environment. I have spent hours trying to reconstruct the environment but am still encountering errors.
